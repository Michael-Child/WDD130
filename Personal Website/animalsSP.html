      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Animal Care</h3>
      <p>I have always been close to animals since I was four years old. I wanted to provide animals a safe and comfortable home. When I was young, I always looked for opportunities not only to provide a roof for homeless animals but to also feed them because I feel that animals without a home also struggle for food. I am building this website so that I can homeless animals and provide them with required meals.

        My website has various options for adopting animals, such animals from Zoos or homeowner pets. My website gives you brief details about the pets breed, agae, habits, and proper background information. We also have free medical check ups for the pets.
        
        My website also is a platform where people can donate their animals. We provide great accommodations and healthy food to all our donated animals. We make sure to create a clean environment for them to grow.
        
        My unique selling is that my website not only helps adoption but also welcomes homeowners that cannot afford to care for their pets for any reason. We help donated animals to feel at home at our place until they are adopted again. This stand out from my website is special and unique as compared to other adoption websites.

      <h3>Pet Owner</h3>
      <p> My audiance would be for both pet owners and donors. The website is for pet donors 
        that maybe in a unstable situation to care for their pets and need to find a new home for their pets.
        The website is also for people that want to make a difference and care for animals 
        looking for a home. The people who have provided experience with animal care and deep love for animals
        are our target audience.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      People who love and want to help animals are in the right place. We help find those that
      provide professional care and protection for animals all over the world. You can make a
      difference for these amazing creatures and they will appreciate everything you do.
